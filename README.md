# usesthis

A description of my various workflows in the vein of [Uses This](https://usesthis.com).

## Coding

### Workflows

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for all of my projects. I use [nix](https://nixos.org/) to create disposable development environments. I use [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for code completion. I use a variety of per-language extensions based on the project.

I use [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) when working with Git in corporate environments.

### CLI

I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) as my terminal emulator and [fish](https://fishshell.com) as my interactive shell with minimal customization. 

Other utilities include:

* [httpie](https://httpie.io/) for working with APIs
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for fast searching
* [visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) for data exploration
* [steampipe](https://steampipe.io/) for using SQL to query cloud providers
* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for remote access

## Productivity

* Apple's Reminders as a shared household task tracker for grocery lists, recurring chores, and one-off tasks
* Apple's Calendar. We use shared calender invitations to track shared family events like doctor appointments, household events, and major errands
* [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) for podcasts
* [Documents](https://readdle.com/documents) for on-the-go consumption of PDFs, video, and audio. I frequently grab copies of conference talks or lectures and listen to them on the go
* [Scanner Pro](https://readdle.com/scannerpro) for digitizing documents
* [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) and self-hosted [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/) for RSS
* [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com) for window management
* [Carrot Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/) for weather and alerts

## Writing

Notes written during meetings, while reading, or off-grid are taken down on paper using a [Fisher AG7](https://www.spacepen.com/originalastronautspacepen.aspx). It feels great, writes well, and the [ink](https://www.spacepen.com/cartridge-2.aspx) still works when camping. Notes are moved to Markdown files for long-term storage.

## Reading

When not physical media, I use a [Kindle Scribe](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?th=1) or [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-glare-free/dp/B0CFPJYX7P) for all my reading. I find e-ink to be significantly more comfortable than any other display surface for long-term reading. I convert long media to an e-reader compatible format using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com).

## IRL

I use [GoRuck](https://www.goruck.com/) bags for carrying my gear. I wear [Xero](https://xeroshoes.com/) shoes. I write using a [Fisher AG7](https://www.spacepen.com/shop-space-pens/style/astronaut-series/ag7-original-astronaut-space-pen).
